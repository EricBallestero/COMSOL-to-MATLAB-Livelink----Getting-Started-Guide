# COMSOL-to-MATLAB-Livelink--Getting-Started-Guide
Repository containing a beginner's guide to COMSOL's Livelink for MATLAB

**Getting Started Guide MATLAB-COMSOL-Livelink.pdf** $\rightarrow$ Guide presenting step-by-step information on how to install, code and export COMSOL-driven numerical data into MATLAB.

This guide is intended for people with a minimum background knowledge of both MATLAB® and COMSOL®
Multiphysics software. It aims to provide a basic understanding on how to ‘link’ both software in order
to be able to manipulate COMSOL® through a MATLAB® interface. Such inter-software communication
can become extremely useful when designing complex systems which involve both numerical computation
through MATLAB® and numerical solving through COMSOL® , e.g., systems that require computational
steps between simulation iterations and/or ones whose complex geometry can be parametrically built.

**MATLAB®** (from Matrix Laboratory) is a proprietary programming language fo-
cused on numerical computation tasks which is mostly used by engineers and
scientists to analyse data and design systems. It comes with its own user-
interface featuring plenty of tools to develop numerical systems and interpret
MATLAB® code.

**COMSOL®** is a powerful multi-physics numerical solver and simulation software.
The software facilitates conventional physics-based user interfaces and coupled
systems of partial differential equations (PDEs). COMSOL provides an IDE
and unified workflow for electrical, mechanical, fluid, acoustics, and chemical
applications.
